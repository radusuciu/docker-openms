# docker-openms

[OpenMS](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS) is a C++ library for working with data LC-MS experiments and comes with a wide variety of tools. This project is not affiliated with OpenMS and it exists to scratch my own itch for building docker images for various releases or individual commits of [OpenMS](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS).

Here are links to the official OpenMS repositories which contain Dockerfiles:
